    Issue addressed by the fixture:

    * mocked method's signature checking:
        - https://github.com/testing-cabal/mock/issues/393
        - mock can only accept a spec object / class, and it makes sure that
          that attribute exists, but it does not check whether the given
          attribute is callable, or if its signature is respected in any way.
        - adds autospec argument. If the autospec argument is given, the
          mocked method's signature is also checked.
